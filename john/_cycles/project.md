My first foray into HTML5 game development, which I threw together in about a day, based off of the classic *Tron* light cycle game. The gameplay and AI is extremely simple and the game supports up to two human players and four AI players. 
It should be noted that, at the time of writing, the AI is little more than a random number generator with limited knowledge of the game world. As a result the AI will frequently turn the same direction if the starting conditions are the same 
(it does make some cool designs however).

- Used HTML5 Canvas to draw the game world.
- Controls
- Basic AI
