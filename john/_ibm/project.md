# System Administrator


Acting as a system administrator to several development clusters of x86 (less after 2017) and Power systems. Tasks include, but are not limited to:
- Bring up of nodes (includes determining where the node should be physically installed, networking configuration and talking with support on the raised floor to ensure this happens in a timely manner).
- Managing and repairing package installs for users.
- Troubleshooting and resolving issues for users.
- Learning how to interact with and maintain early user hardware not currently on the market.
- Documentation of bring up procedures for customers and fellow administrators.

## Tools:
- Log Analysis, GPFS, Logstash, Hadoop

Additionally, I have developed new tools to better facilitate my job as a system administrator through use of ksh, bash, awk, sed, python and java programming (depending on which language is best suited for the job).
