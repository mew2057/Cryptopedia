[section name="John"]
A Software Engineer with a passion for user experience and producing quality, maintainable products. When I become 
interested in a subject I throw myself into it head first until I am able to produce a product I am happy with. 

I have experience working in professional environments and working with teams on a multitude of software projects in roles 
ranging from Software Engineer to System Administrator.
