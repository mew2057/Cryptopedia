This was the first game I ever worked on inspired by the *Mega Man* rock group *The Protomen*. 
It was an attempt to make a *Mega Man* styled game that recreated the second half of *The Protomen's Act II: The Father of Death*. 
Gameplay was rather simple, emulating *Mega Man's* platforming, with the player's primary goal being to reach the golden gear at the end of each level. 
The player also had the ability to fire energy balls that would destroy enemies in one hit.

I placed a fair amount of emphasis on the GUI elements: the controls and menu system. The control system was inspired by other iOS games at the time, focusing on player usability and responsiveness. 
The menu system had a similar focus on responsiveness and ease of use, although in retrospect certain elements and semiotics should have been better clarified.

In total the game was my first attempt at anything in this field and I still have a fair amount of pride for it, even if I wish I had worked with some teammates to make an all-around better experience.

- Sprite and Asset creation.
- Designed and implemented a responsive controller for a touch environment.
- Level design and implementation.
- Ladders and fall through platforms.
- Implemented a camera system that prevented the player's hands from blocking visibility of the game world.
