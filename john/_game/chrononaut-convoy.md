Perhaps my favorite prototype to date, this game is an attempt at creating an escort quest fun through the use of time travel.  The player is a chrononaut, something like The Doctor, who has entered a solar system with the intent to stabilize its dying Sun with a fleet of "sun stabilizing ships", 
protecting them from a myriad of obstacles. To achieve their goal, the player must employ time travel to stop and/or reverse time to ensure their convoy reaches the target.

The game was amazingly fun to work on and it was actually quite well scoped for the time frame that we completed it in (one week). At the time of writing the AI still requires some polish and the chasing behaviors still need a fair share of tweaks, but the hosted 
prototype more than adequately outlines the rough concept.

- GUI
- Controls
- Time travel tweaking
- Refined AI behaviors (enemy and convoy)/finite state machines.
- General programmatic polishing
