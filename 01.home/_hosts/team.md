## Your Hosts




[section name="Brandon"]
Brandon Boyer is a Maker, Musician and Designer located in the Hudson Valley. I took an interest in monster sightings, the paranormal, cryptozoology, 
mythology and folklore from a young age. Since elementary school when we would have the scholastic book fair, all I wanted were the books that had 
information of Bigfoot, Nessie, Champ and any creatures I thought were interesting, unknown and would haunt the human mind.

[section name="John"]
John has always been a little weird, he loves cryptids, weird stories and telling people about them. Add his best friend and a tenuous grasp of the 
notion of free time and Cryptopedia was born!
[/section]

[section name="Squatch"]
The myth, the legend and our honorary second host (John is number three).

He'd like to thank Tom Hill for rendering him so excellently ( <a href=https://www.instagram.com/thomasmichaelhill/> Follow Him Here</a> ).
